# :gear:  Setup
For these labs you need Wireshak installed in your device. For Windows and Mac you can download the installer [here](https://www.wireshark.org/#download), for Linux, the commands are as follows

```
# Debian based
apt install wireshark

# From RPMs under Red Hat and alike
yum install wireshark wireshark-qt

# Red Hat based
dnf install wireshark

```
Wireshark is already installed in Kali Linux, if you want a VM with Kali there is a simple guide to help you creating one. 
If you are unable to run Wireshark on a live network connection, you can download a packet trace [here](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/wireshark-traces.zip).
